This is another Java-based emulator of 8-bit Intel 8080 CPU. It is implemented as a plug-in for
[emuStudio](http://emustudio.sf.net), a software-based computer emulation platform\*.

IMPORTANT CHANGE
----------------

This project has been moved directly to [emuStudio](http://github.com/vbmacher/emuStudio) repository as its child
module. Don't worry, the project is NOT dead.

This repository is left here for reference purposes and will not be maintained in the future. For actual
code please refer to the mentioned repository.

Reasons for doing this are:

* Low number of contributors
* Big costs of maintaining separate version
* Too complicated emuStudio release process (having above 20 plugins maitained separately)

For more information, please visit [emuStudio home page](http://emustudio.sourceforge.net/downloads.html).
